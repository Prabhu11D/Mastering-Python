# Flow Control

- it determine execution pathway for the program.
- Types
  - Conditional
  - Exceptions
  - Loops
- it is used to make decisions and code reusable.

## Conditions

- it is the simplest form of flow control

## Exceptions

- Exceptions are not meant for normal flow control and dealing with expected behavior! Use conditionals in cases where behavior is anticipated.
- try has no condition, if try block got error then it goes to except block
- Raising Exceptions
  - if you want to manually raise the error for some condition we can do it with the help of **raise** keyword, then execution will stop in that block

## Loops

- while
- for
- comprehension
