# Object Oriented

- class organize the data, methods and hierarchical relationships
- object orientation is a computational version of the reductionist frameworks that sci‚Äêentists have relied on for centuries to formulate conceptual models of physical systems.
- `dunder` <- 'd'ouble + 'under'score
- even functions also objects in python

- `class variable` - Class variables should be thought of as data universally applicable to all objects of the class.
- `duck typing` python doesn't check the object type when we access attributes or methods, it only checks if the attributes or methods available not the type of the object
